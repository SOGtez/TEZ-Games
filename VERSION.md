# TEZ Games Changelog

## v0.9.25 — Debug name paint preview rendering
- Inject paint CSS as a real style tag for the preview panel instead of React inline styles
- Show raw css_value in the preview panel temporarily for debugging

## v0.9.24 — Fix name paint preview block rendering
- Wrapped preview username span in a flex div so it's treated as a block-level flex item, making background-clip: text clip reliably to the text shape

## v0.9.23 — Remove hover preview from name paint inventory
- Preview panel now only reflects the currently equipped paint, not hover state

## v0.9.22 — Fix name paint preview rendering
- Added display: inline-block to username spans in name paint preview panel and cards — required for background-clip: text to clip the gradient to the text shape instead of flooding the element

## v0.9.21 — Inventory name paint preview + equipped persistence debug
- Name paint cards now show the player's actual username rendered with the paint CSS instead of a generic icon
- Preview panel above the grid shows the currently equipped paint (or the one being hovered) at full size with paint name and rarity
- Inventory API now exposes equipped column errors in the debug banner so missing DB migrations are immediately visible
- Added css_value to cosmetics SELECT so name paint styles are available on the inventory page

## v0.9.20 — Fix cosmetics.icon column not found
- Removed icon from SELECT in inventory and shop APIs — column doesn't exist in DB yet; items now load with ✨ fallback icon

## v0.9.19 — Inventory resilience + debug diagnostics
- API no longer returns 404 if equipped_* columns are missing on players table — falls back to empty equipped object
- If player_cosmetics or cosmetics table errors occur, returns items: [] with a debug field instead of 500
- Inventory page shows a red debug banner when the API reports a DB error, making it easy to diagnose missing migrations

## v0.9.18 — Fix inventory page not showing items
- Replaced Supabase embedded join syntax (cosmetics(id,...)) with two explicit queries — the embedded syntax silently returns null when FK relationships aren't registered in Supabase's schema cache
- Fixed session hydration race: inventory page now waits for localStorage session to load before rendering the "not logged in" state, preventing a flash of empty inventory

## v0.9.17 — Name paints site-wide
- Name paint cosmetics now render everywhere a username appears: sidebar, leaderboard, profile pages, friend list, friend request notifications, Connect 4 online player panels
- css_value from the cosmetics table is parsed into React inline styles supporting gradients, animations, and any CSS paint effect
- Global keyframes added: np-gentle-shift and np-smooth-flow for animated paints
- All player-fetching APIs now batch-load paint_css in one query via attachNamePaints helper
- Equipping a paint in /inventory immediately applies it everywhere on the site for all viewers

## v0.9.16 — Shop & Inventory infrastructure
- Added Shop (🛍️) and Inventory (🎒) links to the sidebar nav
- Shop page (/shop): premium "coming soon" teaser with shimmer title, floating icon, pulse animation, and blurred placeholder item grid
- Inventory page (/inventory): functional with 5 tabs (Name Paints, Banners, Game Skins, Badges, Profile Frames), TEZ Bucks balance, equip/unequip per slot, and empty states ready for when items are added
- New API: GET /api/inventory — owned cosmetics + equipped slots
- New API: POST /api/inventory/equip — equip/unequip with ownership verification
- New API: GET /api/shop/items — all cosmetics from DB, optional type filter
- New API: POST /api/shop/buy — validates balance, deducts TB, adds to player_cosmetics (with refund on failure)

## v0.9.15 — Private recovery code
- Each account now gets a unique private recovery code (format `XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX`, ~10²⁴ combinations)
- Only visible to the account owner on their own profile page — never shown publicly
- Existing accounts get a code auto-generated on next login
- Removed friend code account recovery — friend code is public, using it for recovery was a security risk
- Recovery code shown in profile with copy button and warning to save it somewhere safe

## v0.9.14 — Guest account persistence
- Dual-layer session storage: saves to both localStorage and a 1-year cookie so accounts survive storage clears on either side
- Friend code recovery: "Recover it →" link in UsernameModal lets users restore their account by entering their TEZ-XXXX friend code on a new device
- Session validation on load: if the stored player ID returns a 404 (account deleted), the stale session is automatically cleared
- Email link prompt: after 5 games, guests see an amber sidebar card prompting them to link an email to protect their progress (dismissible)
- Warning badge (⚠) next to username in sidebar for unlinked accounts, with tooltip explaining the risk

## v0.9.13 — Fix online Connect 4 freeze + dot size
- Fixed critical bug where online games froze at turn 4: a remote drop arriving while a local animation was running would be silently discarded and marked as processed, leaving both players stuck forever
- Root cause: `dropping = true` guard in `handleColClick` would reject the remote move, but `processedMoveRef` was already stamped — so the move was lost permanently when the animation finished
- Fix: queue the remote move in `pendingRemoteMoveRef` when animating; flush it as soon as `dropping` goes false
- Reduced last-placed white dot size from 28% to 18% of piece diameter

## v0.9.12 — Connect 4 last-placed piece dot indicator
- Small white dot appears in the center of the most recently dropped piece in all game modes (local, vs AI, online)
- Dot animates in with a spring pop (scale 0→1 with slight overshoot)
- Disappears automatically when the next piece is placed
- Does not appear on ghost piece or piece snatch placements — only normal column drops
- Hidden when win stars are shown at game end

## v0.9.11 — Connect 4 waiting screen redesign
- Removed "Try another way?" toggle from the online waiting screen
- Room code, shareable link (with copy button), QR code, and "Share this with a friend to play!" text are all shown immediately when a room is created
- No hidden sections or expandable panels — everything visible at once in a clean vertical stack

## v0.9.10 — Profanity / slur filter
- Added server-side word filter (`lib/wordFilter.js`) covering racial slurs, ethnic slurs, homophobic slurs, sexist slurs, hate-group terms, and common profanity
- Filter catches exact matches, leetspeak substitutions (4→a, 3→e, 1→i, 0→o, 5→s, etc.), embedded slurs inside longer strings, and separator tricks (n-i-g, n.i.g, n_i_g)
- Applied to username creation (`/api/claim-username`) and email sign-up (`/api/auth/signup`) — runs server-side so it cannot be bypassed
- Client modals show friendly error: "That username is not allowed. Please choose a different one." without revealing which word was matched
- Added `/api/admin/scan-usernames` endpoint (requires `ADMIN_SECRET` env var) to scan all existing usernames and return flagged ones for manual cleanup

## v0.9.9 — Full mobile optimization
- Added viewport meta tag for correct mobile scaling
- Layout: overflow-x hidden to prevent horizontal scroll; header hides redundant "All Games" nav link on mobile; main content padding tightened on mobile; friend request toasts fit within screen width
- Landing page: hero section reduced spacing on mobile; body text uses fluid font size
- Leaderboard: Win% and secondary stat columns hidden on small screens, leaving rank + player + main stat
- Connect 4: board wraps in scrollable container for small screens; power-up grid collapses to 2 columns; menu cards full-width
- Blackjack: action buttons stack vertically on mobile; top bar wraps
- War: menu/game buttons expand to full width on mobile
- Friends page: add-friend grid goes single-column; friend code header wraps
- Profile: stats grid already 2-column on mobile (no change needed)

## v0.9.8 — Connect 4 online multiplayer room system
- Room-based matchmaking: host creates a room with a random 4-char code (e.g. `TEZ7`), shares it with a friend
- Waiting screen shows the room code large + copy button, plus expandable "Try another way?" section with a shareable URL and QR code (client-side, dark theme)
- Guest joins by entering the code in the new "Join a Room" section on the Connect 4 menu, or by visiting `tez-games.com/game/connect4?code=TEZ7` directly (auto-joins)
- Host is always Red (goes first), guest is always Blue; usernames shown in each player card
- Moves relayed in real-time via Supabase Realtime broadcast channels — piece drop animations fire automatically on the opponent's board
- Chess clock, power-ups, and Rumble mode all work in online play
- Disconnect detection: 30 s of missed heartbeats → warning banner; 60 s → win awarded and stats reported
- Post-game: "Rematch" (creates new room, opponent auto-joins) and "← Menu" buttons
- Stats reported independently for both players via `reportGameResult`
- `game_rooms` table stores room state; rooms expire after 10 minutes if no one joins
- Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` + `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` env vars required in Vercel

## v0.9.7 — Connect 4 chess clock timer
- 4-minute chess clock for online and AI modes (`timerDuration` prop, default 240s)
- Per-player countdown displayed in player cards; timer only ticks on the active player's side
- Timer pauses during power-up spin animations and bomb phases
- Color changes at <30s (orange, pulse) and <10s (red, urgent flash + glow)
- Timeout triggers game over: result banner shows "You ran out of time! ⏰" / "Opponent ran out of time! ⏰" (online), or "P1/P2 ran out of time! ⏰" (local), or "AI ran out of time! ⏰"
- Online mode: `timerSync` move type sent periodically so both clients stay in sync
- AI player 2 has no timer (AI responds instantly)

## v0.9.6 — Connect 4 multiplayer-ready refactor
- Renamed component to `Connect4Game`, added `"use client"` directive
- Accepts `gameMode` ('local'|'ai'|'online'), `playerColor` ('red'|'blue'), `onMove`, `incomingMove`, `onGameEnd` props
- When `gameMode` is passed, skips menu and starts the game directly
- Online mode: turn indicator shows "Your Turn" / "Waiting for opponent...", all board interaction disabled when it's not the local player's turn
- `onMove` fires for every local action: `{ type: 'drop', col }`, `{ type: 'bomb', col }`, `{ type: 'snatch', row, col }`, `{ type: 'ghost', row, col }`, `{ type: 'useItem' }`
- `incomingMove` prop processes the opponent's move (all types) as if they clicked
- `onGameEnd({ winner, mode })` fires when the game ends; stats tracked for online mode the same as AI mode
- Menu, local 2P, and AI modes all work exactly as before

## v0.9.5 — Fix daily login bonus repeating on refresh
- Normalize stored `last_login_bonus` to `YYYY-MM-DD` before comparing (full timestamp strings caused the check to always be `true`)
- Replace `.or()` Supabase filter with two separate `.is(null)` / `.lt()` conditional UPDATEs — avoids filter quirks in Supabase JS
- Add client-side localStorage guard: toast only shows once per calendar day per device, even if concurrent requests fire

## v0.9.4 — Fix daily login bonus race condition
- Daily login bonus now uses a conditional server-side UPDATE filtered to rows where `last_login_bonus` is null or before today — only one concurrent request can win the write, preventing duplicate awards on rapid page loads/refreshes

## v0.9.3 — Connect 4 AI upgrade + stat gating
- Replaced simple AI with Minimax + alpha-beta pruning (depth 6): never misses a win or obvious block, evaluates center control and multi-in-a-row patterns
- Small random factor among near-best moves so AI varies its play
- AI response capped at 300ms (feels like thinking, not instant)
- Local 2-player games no longer report stats — only vs AI games count toward leaderboard/TEZ Points/TEZ Bucks

## v0.9.2 — Fix navbar layout centering
- TEZ Games logo is now absolutely centered in the navbar and stays centered regardless of left/right content
